# 🔧 Fixes Applied to Resolve 404 Errors

## 📊 Diagnostic Summary

I investigated your 404 error and found the root cause along with several related issues.

---

## 🐛 Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Issue #1: Missing Python Dependencies
**Problem**: `Flask-CORS` and `python-dotenv` were not installed
- These were listed in `requirements.txt` but never installed
- Backend couldn't start due to import errors

**Fix**: Installed all dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

### ✅ Issue #2: Port 5000 Conflict (Main Cause of 404)
**Problem**: macOS Control Center was blocking port 5000
- Flask backend couldn't start because port 5000 was already taken
- This is a common issue on macOS 12+ (Monterey and later)
- Without the backend running, all API calls returned 404

**Fix**: Changed backend to use port 5001
- Updated `vite.config.js` proxy to point to `localhost:5001`
- Backend now starts successfully on port 5001

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

### ⚠️ Issue #3: Missing Azure OpenAI API Key
**Problem**: No `.env` file with `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Backend will fail when trying to run diagnostics
- Not a 404 error, but would cause 500 errors

**Fix**: Created `env_template.txt` with configuration template
- You need to create `.env` file and add your API key

**Status**: ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED** (see below)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps - How to Run Your Application

### Step 1: Create .env File with Your API Key

```bash
cd "/Users/zhenduoyang/Desktop/PSA'25/my_solution/backend"
cp env_template.txt .env
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Azure OpenAI API key from the PSA portal.

### Step 2: Test Your Setup

```bash
cd "/Users/zhenduoyang/Desktop/PSA'25/my_solution"
./test_setup.sh
```

This will verify all dependencies and configuration.

### Step 3: Start the Backend (Terminal 1)

```bash
cd "/Users/zhenduoyang/Desktop/PSA'25/my_solution"
./start_backend.sh
```

You should see:
```
🔧 Initializing L2 Diagnostic System...
   ✓ Log searcher initialized (6 log files)
   ✓ Knowledge Base loaded (X articles)
   ✓ Case Log loaded (X historical cases)
   ✓ Azure OpenAI connected

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

### Step 4: Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd "/Users/zhenduoyang/Desktop/PSA'25/my_solution"
./start_frontend.sh
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v5.2.0  ready in XXX ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/**

## 🎯 Quick Test

Once both servers are running, test the backend directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why Port 5000 Didn't Work

macOS Monterey (12.0+) introduced AirPlay Receiver which uses port 5000 by default. You can verify with:

```bash
lsof -ti:5000
ps -p $(lsof -ti:5000)
```

### Solutions for Port Conflicts

1. **Use a different port** (recommended) - What we did ✅
2. Disable AirPlay Receiver in System Preferences
3. Use port forwarding/tunneling

### Architecture

```
Browser (localhost:5173)
    ↓
Vite Dev Server (React Frontend)
    ↓ Proxy /api/* requests
Flask Backend (localhost:5001)
    ↓
Azure OpenAI API (gpt-4.1-nano)
```

---

## ✅ Current Status

```
✅ Virtual environment configured
✅ All Python dependencies installed (Flask, Flask-CORS, OpenAI, python-dotenv)
✅ Port conflict resolved (using 5001 instead of 5000)
✅ Frontend proxy updated to point to correct port
✅ Data files verified (logs, knowledge base, case log)
✅ Startup scripts created and tested
⚠️  Azure OpenAI API key needed (you must add this)
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If backend won't start:
1. Check if .env file exists and has valid API key
2. Verify port 5001 is not in use: `lsof -ti:5001`
3. Check terminal logs for error messages

### If you still get 404:
1. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5001/health`
2. Verify frontend is running: open `http://localhost:5173`
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### If API calls fail with 500 error:
1. Check API key is correct in `.env`
2. Verify API key has proper permissions
3. Check backend terminal for error details

## ✨ Summary

The 404 error was caused by **port 5000 being blocked by macOS Control Center**, preventing the Flask backend from starting. I've:

1. ✅ Installed missing dependencies
2. ✅ Changed to port 5001
3. ✅ Updated frontend configuration
4. ✅ Created helpful startup scripts
5. ⚠️ Created API key template (you need to add your key)

**You're ready to go!** Just add your API key to the `.env` file and run the startup scripts.
