# 🚀 Deploy to Vercel - CRITICAL SETUP

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Root Directory Must Be BLANK!

After pushing the reorganized code, you **MUST** make sure Vercel's Root Directory is **BLANK (EMPTY)**.

---

## 🔧 Required Steps

### Step 1: CLEAR Root Directory in Vercel

1. Go to: **Vercel Dashboard** → **Your Project** → **Settings** → **General**

2. Find: **Root Directory**

3. **Make it BLANK (completely empty)** - Delete any text in there

4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **⋯** on latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

## ✅ Why Root Directory Must Be Blank

The data files (`Problem Statement 3.../`) are at the **repo root**, not inside `my_solution/`.

```
/                                    ← Vercel needs to see THIS level
├── Problem Statement 3.../          ← Data files are here
└── my_solution/                     ← Your code is here
    ├── api/
    ├── backend/
    └── frontend/
```

If Root Directory = `my_solution`:
- ❌ Vercel can't see data files
- ❌ API functions fail (can't find logs, KB, etc.)
- ❌ Deployment fails

If Root Directory = **BLANK**:
- ✅ Vercel sees entire repo
- ✅ Can access data files
- ✅ `vercel.json` at root tells Vercel where everything is
- ✅ Everything works!

---

## 📊 How It Works

With Root Directory blank, the root `vercel.json` tells Vercel:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd my_solution && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "my_solution/dist",
  "builds": [
    { "src": "my_solution/api/**/*.py" }  ← Find API here
  ]
}
```

Vercel then:
1. ✅ Builds frontend from `my_solution/`
2. ✅ Deploys API from `my_solution/api/`
3. ✅ API can access data files at repo root
4. ✅ Everything works!

---

## 🧪 Verify Deployment

After redeployment, test:

```bash
# Test endpoint should work
curl https://psa-code-sprint-25-frontend.vercel.app/api/test

# Should return:
{"message": "Test endpoint works!", "method": "GET"}
```

Then try submitting an alert in the UI!

## 🚨 If Deployment Still Fails

### Check Build Logs

Look for errors like:
- `Cannot find module` → Check import paths
- `File not found` → Check if Root Directory is blank
- `Build failed` → Check if `vercel.json` is at repo root

### Verify Settings

1. **Root Directory**: Must be **BLANK** (not `my_solution`, not `.`, just empty)
2. **Framework Preset**: Should be "Other" or "Vite"
3. **Build Command**: Should auto-detect or use what's in `vercel.json`
4. **Output Directory**: Should be `my_solution/dist`

---

## ✨ Summary

1. **Root Directory = BLANK (empty, nothing, nada)** ⚠️ CRITICAL!
2. Root `vercel.json` handles all the path configuration
3. Redeploy
4. Test and enjoy! 🎉

**The key: Root Directory must be COMPLETELY EMPTY so Vercel can see the data files!**
