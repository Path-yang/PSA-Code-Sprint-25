# Ticketing System - Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

Your ticketing system is complete and includes:

### Backend Features
- **SQLite database** with 3 pre-seeded demo tickets (2 active, 1 closed)
- **Full CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Close, Delete tickets
- **Flask API endpoints** for local development
- **Vercel serverless endpoints** at `/api/tickets` for production

### Frontend Features
- **"Save as Ticket"** button after running diagnostics
- **Active/Closed Tickets** tabs for easy navigation
- **Ticket detail view** with full editing capabilities:
  - Edit root cause and technical details
  - Modify resolution steps
  - Add notes
  - Add custom fields (key-value pairs)
  - Close tickets with accurate timestamps
- **Time tracking**: Shows "Open for X hours" or "Resolved in X hours"
- **Beautiful modern UI** with status badges and responsive design

### Database
- **Local Dev**: SQLite at `my_solution/backend/tickets.db` (permanent storage)
- **Vercel Production**: Neon Postgres in Singapore region (permanent storage) ✨
- **Pre-seeded tickets**: 3 demo tickets in Neon for judges
- **Auto-detection**: Code automatically uses Postgres on Vercel, SQLite locally
- **Permanent storage**: All tickets persist indefinitely on Neon! 🎉

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Steps

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Root Directory Setting

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project → Settings → General
2. **Root Directory**: Make sure it's set to **BLANK** (empty field)
3. **Save** if you changed it

This is crucial because:
- `/api` folder must be at repository root for Vercel to detect serverless functions
- Build commands point to `my_solution/` directory
- Data files remain accessible

---

## 📋 What to Do on Vercel

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
Since you've already set up Vercel, it should **automatically deploy** from the latest GitHub push.

1. Check Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Wait for the build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for any errors

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
If automatic deployment doesn't trigger:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
3. Select the latest commit

---

## ✅ Testing the Ticketing System

### On Your Live Site

1. **Run a diagnosis** with any test case
2. **Click "💾 Save as Ticket"** button
3. **Click "📋 View Tickets"** to see all tickets
4. **Click on a ticket** to view/edit details
5. **Try editing**: Root cause, resolution steps, add notes
6. **Add custom fields**: e.g., "assigned_to: L2 Team"
7. **Close ticket** to mark as resolved
8. **Switch tabs** to see active vs closed tickets

### Demo Tickets Available
The database comes with 3 pre-seeded tickets:
- **Ticket #1**: Active - Container duplicate issue (from your test case)
- **Ticket #2**: Closed - EDI message error (resolved)
- **Ticket #3**: Active - Vessel not found (escalated)

Judges will see these immediately when they visit your site!

---

## 🧪 Local Testing (Optional)

### Start Backend
```bash
cd my_solution/backend
source ../venv/bin/activate
python webapp.py --port 5001
```

### Start Frontend (in another terminal)
```bash
cd my_solution
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and test ticketing system.

## 📊 For Hackathon Judges

### Why Neon Postgres is Perfect for This Hackathon

✅ **Permanent storage** - All tickets persist indefinitely  
✅ **Singapore region** - Low latency for PSA/Asia judges  
✅ **Auto-detection** - Code switches between SQLite (local) and Postgres (Vercel)  
✅ **Pre-seeded demo tickets** - 3 tickets ready for judges to see  
✅ **Industry standard** - Production-grade Postgres database  
✅ **Free tier** - No cost for hackathon usage  
✅ **JSONB support** - Efficient JSON storage for diagnosis data

### Judges Can:
1. **Test the live site** at your Vercel URL
2. **Download the repo** and run locally with demo data
3. **See pre-populated tickets** immediately
4. **Create new tickets** from diagnostics
5. **Edit all fields** including AI-generated content
6. **Track time** accurately from creation to closure

## 🔧 If Issues Occur

### Vercel Deployment Fails
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure Root Directory is **BLANK**
3. Verify environment variables (AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)

### Tickets Not Loading
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test `/api/tickets` endpoint directly: `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/tickets`
3. Should return JSON array of tickets

### Database Not Found
1. Verify `my_solution/backend/tickets.db` exists in repo
2. Check Vercel build logs for file access errors

---

## ✨ What Makes This Implementation Special

1. **Production-Ready**: Full database with CRUD operations
2. **Judge-Friendly**: Pre-seeded demo tickets, zero setup
3. **Fully Editable**: Users can modify all AI-generated content
4. **Time Accurate**: Precise timestamps for creation, updates, closure
5. **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with great UX
6. **Clean Architecture**: Follows your existing structure perfectly
7. **Works Everywhere**: Identical behavior on Vercel and local dev

---

## 📝 Summary

✅ **Built**: Complete ticketing system with SQLite database  
✅ **Committed**: All code and database pushed to GitHub  
✅ **Deployed**: Should auto-deploy to Vercel  
✅ **Tested Locally**: Build succeeds, database works  
✅ **Demo Ready**: 3 pre-seeded tickets for judges

### Next Steps:
1. Check Vercel deployment status
2. Test ticketing system on your live site
3. Done! 🎉

Your hackathon submission is production-ready with a comprehensive ticketing system that showcases real-world L2 support capabilities!
